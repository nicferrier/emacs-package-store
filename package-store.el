;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A simple adaption for Emacs' package system, this stores downloaded
;; packages directly in a cache.  This promotes easier transfer to
;; other machines or disconnected (from the Internet) testing.

;;; Source code
;;
;; package-store's code can be found here:
;;   http://github.com/nicferrier/package-store

;;; Style note
;;
;; This codes uses the Emacs style of:
;;
;;    package-store--private-function
;;
;; for private functions.


;;; Code:
